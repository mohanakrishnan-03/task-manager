# Task Handler

Task Handler is a simple web application that allows users to create, view, and delete tasks. Each task consists of a topic and content, displayed in a card-like container with a delete button. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s a lightweight, responsive app perfect for managing to-do lists or notes.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Input a topic and content via a pop-up form, with validation to prevent empty submissions.
- **Delete Tasks**: Each task has a delete button ("×") to remove it instantly.
- **Responsive Design**: Tasks are displayed in a scrollable, centered container, suitable for desktop and mobile.
- **Card Layout**: Tasks are grouped in styled containers with a clean, modern look.
- **Accessible**: Delete buttons include ARIA labels for screen reader support.
